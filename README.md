# Swimming-Times-Identifier
Takes pool length (long course meters, short course meters, or short course yards), event, age group, gender, and your time and tells you your time (B, BB, A, AA, AAA, or AAAA) and what time you need to get the next time. Useful tool for knowing your swim times going into meets.

Made for a sibling over a snow day. I'm a runner :)
